# Build a Boilerplate Using Bash ðŸš€  

This project was completed as part of the [freeCodeCamp Bash Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-bash-by-building-a-boilerplate/build-a-boilerplate).  

## Project Overview  
The course contains **170 lessons**, where you learn to use terminal commands by building a website boilerplate entirely through the command line.  

## My Progress  
I successfully completed all **170 challenges** in just **1 hour and 10 minutes**! ðŸ˜²  

## Key Learnings  
Throughout this course, I learned:  
- Core terminal commands for navigating and managing the file system.  
- Creating and organizing project folders and files using Bash.  
- Editing file contents directly from the terminal.  
- Efficiently using shortcuts and commands to save time during development.  

## Experience  
The experience was intense but highly rewarding! Finishing such a large number of lessons in a short amount of time was a great challenge and achievement. ðŸŽ‰
